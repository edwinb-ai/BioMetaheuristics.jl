## Who is this package for

This package should/could be used by:

- **Practitioners**: people in need of a _black box optimization_ framework
  for when they know very little about the problem at hand.
- **Students**: wanting to learn about nature-inspired algorithms, stochastic optimization
  or want a general survey of the current literature.
- **Researchers**: who want to employ different algorithms at once, test them or use them
  as comparison for their own developed algorithms.

TODO
- Examples
- Basic optimization theory
- basics of metaheuristics
- Convergence
